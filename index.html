<h1> Welcome to a website dedicated to my four beautiful dogs! </h1>
</div>
<p><big>Hi! My name is Samantha Scheinin and I am making this page dedicated to my four amazingly cute dogs. I am sickly obssessed with them and cannot express how much I love them. Being a native Houstonian and going to school in Georgia is SUCH a struggle when you are not able to see your four sweethearts as often as you would like, so I'm using this website as a way to ease the pain of being five states away!</big></p>
<p><big> This website will consist of background information on all four of my dogs as well as ample pictures of their cute faces! </big></p>
<div style="text-align:center;color:#3300CC"><h2>Maggie Mae</h2></div>
<div style="text-align:center"><h3>Maggie Mae, Maggie for short, is a the oldest of my four dogs. She is a fourteen year old King Charles Cavalier Spaniel. King Charles are known for their sweet temperments, gentleness, and playful mannerisms. They also are BIG cuddliers, which who wouldn't love cuddling with that sweet face. Maggie is one of the most relaxed and easy going dogs I have ever had. She is, however, a bit of a princess but we let her get away with it! Maggie unfortunately suffers from an enlarged heart and was very sick at the beginning of last year and had to spend multiple nights in at the vet. She now is like a dog that ages backwards and has never been more youthful!</h3></div>

<div style="text-align:center;color:#3300CC"><h2>Homer</h2></div>
<div style="text-align:center"><h3>Homer is an eleven year old Golden Retriever. Homer is a very lax and calm dog. Ever since we got Homer, at a basebal auction, he has ALWAYS loved to sleep. Homer tends to keep to himself and not always love to interact with other dogs. When we got the youngest dogs, Gracie and Stella, it took Homer many months to get accustomed to his new siblings. All that aside Homer is loving, gentle, and friendly dog, who craves your affection.</h3></div>

<div style="text-align:center;color:#3300CC"><h2>Gracie</h2></div>
<div style="text-align:center"><h3>Sweet sweet Gracie. She is nothing but a lover! Gracie was originally my older sister's dog, but she was a college student and it was too hard to manage both and ended up bringing her home to the family. Gracie is a rescued King Charles Cavalier Spaniel. She was left on the side of the highway in a field with other puppies. It can be assumed she was from a puppy mill and spent the majority of her first years of life in a cage. This can be assumed due to her hind legs not growing properly. Gracie definetly has trust issues because of her past abusive life. All that aside Gracie tends to be people's favorite whenever they visit the Scheinin house. Her pudgy physique and lazy eye are only a few of her darling attributes! </h3></div>

<div style="text-align:center;color:#3300CC"><h2>Stella</h2></div>
<div style="text-align:center"><h3>Stella is the youngest of the four dogs. She is rambunctious, crazy mutt. The vet believes she part red heeler part something else. My older brother, Max, got Stella at the Austin pound his sophomore year of college as well and to no ones surprise brought stella home within two months. Stella is a bit of a wild one who loves to exert her energy. Most people either absolutely adore Stella or absolutely loathe her. She is just polar opposite from other three who are quite docile. Stella means well at heart and just gets a little too excited for some people's liking. She is one of the smartest, funniest, and lovingest dogs I've ever had!</h3></div>

<p> Finally, after all my bragging and showing off of my cute pups I thought it was only fair to show off some other cuties. I've attached some random videos of cute dogs! Enjoy!
